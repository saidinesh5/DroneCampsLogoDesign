# Drone Camps RC - Logo Design

These are my entries for [DC/RC - MASCOT LOGO DESIGN CONTEST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvaJWkeKCeQ)

### The main entries are:
  - **Campie** - the mascot. Campie strated off it's life as scribble representing a hybrid between a Tent and a Quadcopter. It comes in two variants. A Peeking Campie and a Campie that flies!
  - **Campfire** - the logo. Using the Lipo fires to keep oneself warm is still a bad idea! There are 3 variants: Monochrome, Blue Flame and Red flame.
  - **DC/RC Logo** - just a logo created with alphabets from Drone Camps RC.

I have made sure that the logos are easily printable, especially on T-Shirts.
I have also animated Campie, for video intros etc..
