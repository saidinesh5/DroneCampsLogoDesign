# Drone Camps RC - Logo Design

These are my entries for [DC/RC - MASCOT LOGO DESIGN CONTEST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvaJWkeKCeQ)

## The main entries are:
### Campie - the mascot.
Campie started off it's life as scribble of a cross between a Tent and a Quadcopter

### Campfire - the logo.
Using the Lipo fires to keep oneself warm is still a bad idea! There are 3 variants: Red Flame, Blue Flame and Monochrome.
